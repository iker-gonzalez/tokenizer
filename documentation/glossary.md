|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Token**     | A digital asset created and managed on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various assets or utilities, such as currency, property, or access rights. |
| **ERC-20**    | A technical standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, defining a set of rules that all tokens must follow. |
| **Minting**   | The process of creating new tokens and adding them to the total supply.                              |
| **Burning**   | The process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply.              |
| **Total Supply** | The total amount of tokens that will ever be created.                                             |

## Blockchain Technology

| Term               | Definition                                                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blockchain**     | A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures security and transparency. |
| **Smart Contract** | Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms. |
| **Decentralized**  | A system where control is distributed across multiple points rather than being centralized in a single entity. |
| **Consensus Mechanism** | A protocol used by blockchain networks to achieve agreement on a single data value or state of the network, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). |
| **Proof of Work (PoW)** | A consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. |
| **Proof of Stake (PoS)** | A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. |
| **Node**           | A computer that participates in the blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions. |
| **Hash**           | A function that converts an input (or 'message') into a fixed-length string of bytes. Hashes are used in blockchain to ensure data integrity. |
| **Block**          | A collection of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain.                  |
| **Mining**         | The process of validating and adding new transactions to the blockchain, typically involving solving complex mathematical problems. |
| **Fork**           | A split in the blockchain network where two separate chains are created, often due to changes in the protocol or software. |
| **Ledger**         | A record of all transactions that have occurred on the blockchain.                                   |
| **Immutable**      | The property of blockchain data that makes it unchangeable once it has been recorded.                |
| **Cryptography**   | The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, used extensively in blockchain to secure transactions and data. |
| **Wallet**         | A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies and tokens.            |
| **Private Key**    | A secret key used to sign transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address.                  |
| **Public Key**     | A key that is shared publicly and used to receive transactions.                                      |
| **dApp (Decentralized Application)** | An application that runs on a decentralized network, such as Ethereum, rather than a centralized server. |

## Ethereum Platform

| Term               | Definition                                                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ethereum**       | A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). |
| **Ether (ETH)**    | The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, used to pay for transaction fees and computational services. |
| **Gas**            | A unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to perform operations on the Ethereum network. |
| **Etherscan**      | A blockchain explorer for Ethereum, allowing users to view transactions, addresses, smart contracts, and other blockchain data. |
| **Hardhat**        | A development environment for Ethereum software, used for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging Ethereum applications. |
| **Solidity**       | A programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.                     |
| **Testnet**        | A separate blockchain used for testing and development purposes, where developers can deploy and test their applications without using real Ether. |
| **Mainnet**        | The main Ethereum network where actual transactions take place and real Ether is used.                |
| **ABI (Application Binary Interface)** | A standard way for interacting with smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, defining how data should be encoded and decoded. |
| **ERC-721**        | A standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for the creation of unique digital assets. |
| **Metamask**       | A browser extension and mobile app that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, manage their wallets, and sign transactions. |
