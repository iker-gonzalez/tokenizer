# Tokenizer: Build Your Own Token

## Project Overview
Tokenizer is a hands-on project where you'll create and deploy a custom blockchain token on the Ethereum platform. You'll learn to develop smart contracts, deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, and implement basic security features.

## Key Objectives
- Create a token with **42** in its name.
- Develop using the Ethereum blockchain platform (ERC-20).
- Deploy the token and provide the contract address and network details.
- Document the process in a clear, concise manner.

## Contract Address and Network Details
- Contract Address: [To be provided after deployment]
- Network: Ethereum Mainnet/Testnet

## Development Tools and Setup Instructions
1. Install Node.js and npm from the official website.
2. Install Truffle globally using npm: `npm install -g truffle`.
3. Set up a new Truffle project by running `truffle init` in your project directory.
4. Create a new Solidity smart contract for your token in the `code/contracts` directory.
5. Implement the ERC-20 token standard in your smart contract.
6. Write migration scripts in the `deploy` directory to deploy your smart contract.
7. Configure the Truffle project to connect to the Ethereum network (e.g., using Infura or a local Ethereum node).
8. Compile and deploy your smart contract using Truffle.
9. Verify the deployment and interact with your token using tools like Remix, MetaMask, or Etherscan.

## How the Token Works and How to Use It
The token is an ERC-20 compliant token on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used for various purposes such as transferring value, accessing services, or participating in decentralized applications (dApps). Users can interact with the token using Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, and view transactions on Etherscan.

## Contract Verification on Etherscan
After deploying the contract, you can verify it on Etherscan using the following link:
