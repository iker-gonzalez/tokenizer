# Tokenizer: Build Your Own Token

## Project Overview
Tokenizer is a hands-on project where you'll create and deploy a custom blockchain token. You'll learn to develop smart contracts, deploy on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain), and implement basic security features.

## Key Objectives
- Create a token with **42** in its name.
- Develop using a blockchain platform like Ethereum (ERC-20) or Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20).
- Deploy the token and provide the contract address and network details.
- Document the process in a clear, concise manner.

## Optional Bonus
- Implement a **multisig** system for enhanced security.
