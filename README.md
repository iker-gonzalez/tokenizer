# Tokenizer: Build Your Own Token

## Project Overview
Tokenizer is a hands-on project where you'll create and deploy a custom blockchain token on the Ethereum platform. You'll learn to develop smart contracts, deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, and implement basic security features.

## Key Objectives
- Create a token with **42** in its name.
- Develop using the Ethereum blockchain platform (ERC-20).
- Deploy the token and provide the contract address and network details.
- Document the process in a clear, concise manner.

## Contract Address and Network Details
- Contract Address: [0x14925869366d3c8C481F20289F94DB8620050541](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x14925869366d3c8C481F20289F94DB8620050541)
- Network: Sepolia Testnet

## Token Information
